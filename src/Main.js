            <strong>Arc</strong> is like Notion meets Google Calender but for your weekly to-do list. It's a personal project I've slowly designed and coded in my free time. I've put a lot of thought into crafting what I think is a satsifying user experience. Please check it out.

            <strong>Treaty Home Duo</strong> sound dampening panels were designed to help employees transition into their new work-from-home reality. I spent a few weeks designing and prototyping these panels in order to see if there would be product-market fit.

            <strong>Animator</strong> is an innovative stateful UI animation tool, meant for
            developers and designers to use together. I led its design & coded
            the initial versions of its user interface in React before our team raised a
            seed round.
